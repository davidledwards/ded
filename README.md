The *ped*estrian text editor.

## Background

The genesis of this project stemmed from a desire to learn the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language while also building something useful and nontrivial.

During my college years studying computer science, I spent evenings and weekends developing a text editor for MS-DOS in Turbo Pascal 3.0. Unfortunately, the source code has been lost forever, but rest assured that reviewing that code today would be a dreadful experience.

This is a hobbyist project with the goal of building a fully functional terminal-based editor supporting multiple buffers and windows, regular expression search, syntax highlighting, and perhaps other features yet to be decided. I plan to develop most everything from scratch as opposed to using prebuilt libraries. The desire is to learn, not to go fast.
