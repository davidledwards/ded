# Sample ped configuration file.

# This section contains settings that are usually offered as command-line

# Enables highlighting of the cursor row.
# Default = false

# Shows line numbers in the left margin.
# Default = false

# Makes \n characters visible using a special character.

# This section allows the configuration of alternative color themes.
#
# Colors are a combination of foreground and background expressed as an array,
# and whose values must be in the range of [0, 255]. Colors follow the 8-bit
# ANSI standard at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit>.
#
# Note that colors handling is not very robust at this point in time, so expect
# this section to evolve.

# This section allows keys and key sequences to be rebound to editing
# operations.
#
# An entry in this section follows the given format:
# "key" = "operation"
#
# The list of available keys and operations can be discovered using the command
# line options --print-keys and --print-ops, respectively.
#
# The current key bindings can be discovered using --print-bindings.
#
# Even though support for runtime binding exists, it is recommended not to
# rebind keys at this point in time, as critical guardrails restricting what
# can be rebound are not in place.
