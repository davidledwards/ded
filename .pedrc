# This section allows key sequences to be rebound to editing operations.
#
# An entry in this section follows the given format, where a sequence of keys
# can be chained together using a ":" delimiter:
#
#   "key[:key]..." = "operation"
#
# The list of available keys and operations can be discovered using the command
# line options --print-keys and --print-ops, respectively, and current key
# bindings can be discovered using --print-bindings.
#
# A handful of keys are prohibited from being rebound, which are noted below
# with an explanation as to why:
#
#   C-q : to ensure the user is able to quit ped
#   C-g : to ensure the user is able to cancel any operation
#   ESC : this key is a prefix of many other keys
#   tab : has a ubiquitous meaning
#   ret : has a ubiquitous meaning
#   del : has a ubiquitous meaning
#
[bindings]
# A binding to a single key.
"C-^" = "set-mark"

# A binding to a sequence of keys.
"ESC:x:y:z" = "move-top"
