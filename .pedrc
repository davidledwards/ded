# A sample ped configuration file, which adheres to the TOML specification.

# This section contains settings that are usually offered as command-line
# options.
#
[settings]
# Enables highlighting of the cursor row.
# Default = false
show-spotlight = true

# Shows line numbers in the left margin.
# Default = false
show-lines = true

# Makes \n characters visible using a special character.
# Default = false
show-eol = true

# Sets the tab stop size.
# Default = 3
tab-size = 4

# This section allows the configuration of alternative color themes.
#
# Colors are a combination of foreground and background expressed as an array,
# and whose values must be in the range of [0, 255]. Colors follow the 8-bit
# ANSI standard at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit>.
#
# Note that color handling is not very robust at this point in time, so expect
# this section to evolve.

# This section allows key sequences to be rebound to editing operations.
#
# An entry in this section follows the given format, where a sequence of keys
# can be chained together using a ":" delimiter:
#
#   "key[:key]..." = "operation"
#
# The list of available keys and operations can be discovered using the command
# line options --print-keys and --print-ops, respectively, and current key
# bindings can be discovered using --print-bindings.
#
# A handful of keys are prohibited from being rebound, which are noted below
# with an explanation as to why:
#
#   C-q : to ensure the user is able to quit ped
#   C-g : to ensure the user is able to cancel any operation
#   ESC : this key is a prefix of many other keys
#   tab : has a ubiquitous meaning
#   ret : has a ubiquitous meaning
#   del : has a ubiquitous meaning
#
[bindings]
# A binding to a single key.
"C-^" = "set-mark"

# A binding to a sequence of keys.
"ESC:x:y:z" = "move-top"
